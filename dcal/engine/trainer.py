"""
Generic training harness.

Purpose:
- Handle training epochs, optimization steps, checkpointing, logging, and
  dispatch to task-specific engines for loss computation and metrics.

Design:
- `Trainer` consumes a config, model, optimizer, schedulers, dataloaders, and
  a task engine (`fgvc_engine` or `reid_engine`).

I/O:
- Trainer.train() and Trainer.validate() methods.
