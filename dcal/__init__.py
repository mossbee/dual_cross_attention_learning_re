"""
DCAL (Dual Cross-Attention Learning) shared toolkit for FGVC and Re-ID.

Overview:
- Provides shared backbones, attention modules (GLCA, PWCA), training engines,
  datasets, and utilities so FGVC and Re-ID reuse most components.
- Implements ideas described in `dual_cross_attention_learning.md` while
  keeping task-specific differences isolated to data, losses, and evaluators.

References: `dual_cross_attention_learning.md`.
